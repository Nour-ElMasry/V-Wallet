# V-Wallet

This was a project idea I came up with for one of my university subjects called (Web Application Development)


The Revolut app was my main inspiration for this project idea.

in this app you can: 
 - Store your credit cards, transfer money between them and delete a certain credit card
 - Invest in one of the 4 provided Crypto Currencies, Track your profits and cash out at any time


The Web stack used:
 - Front-End: ReactJS
 - Back-End: Spring boot
 - Database:  MySQL
